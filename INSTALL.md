# Installing and updating git-cowork

Three ways, all without Gatekeeper warnings:

- **[One line](#quick-install)**: downloads the newest release. Easiest; the
  app tells you about updates and installs them for you.
- **[Homebrew](#homebrew)**: install and update with `brew`.
- **[From source](#install-from-source)**: builds on your Mac. For changing
  the code or following `main`.

## Quick install

Needs an Apple Silicon Mac with macOS 14 or newer, and git (Apple's command
line tools: `xcode-select --install` if `git --version` doesn't work).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael-smao/git-cowork/main/install.sh | bash
```

It downloads the newest release from GitHub, checks its checksum, puts
`git-cowork.app` in `/Applications` (or `~/Applications` if you can't write
there) and links the `git cowork` command into `~/.local/bin`. Running the
same line again updates. Settings for the script:

```bash
# a specific version, and only for your user
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael-smao/git-cowork/main/install.sh | GIT_COWORK_VERSION=0.2.0 GIT_COWORK_PREFIX=~/Applications bash
```

**Updates**: once a day the app checks GitHub for a newer release. When there
is one, the status bar shows "Update to x.y.z"; click it, then **Update Now**
and **Restart**. Or use **git-cowork › Check for Updates…**. Turn the daily
check off in Settings › Updates.

Please don't download the zip from the release page by hand: macOS blocks
apps downloaded in a browser. `curl` doesn't trigger that block. If you already
have a blocked copy, run the line above; it replaces it.

## Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask michael-smao/tap/git-cowork
```

This installs `git-cowork.app` to `/Applications` and `git cowork` to
Homebrew's `bin`. Update with `brew upgrade --cask git-cowork` (a plain
`brew upgrade` includes it). The app still tells you when there's a new
version, and shows that command instead of updating itself. After an update
macOS may ask once more for access to your folders, because each build has
its own signature.

To remove it: `brew uninstall --cask git-cowork`.

## Install from source

### Requirements

- A Mac with Apple Silicon (M1 or newer)
- macOS 14 Sonoma or newer, recent enough to get Swift 6 (see below)
- Xcode Command Line Tools with **Swift 6 or newer** (for `git`, `swift` and `make`)

Check whether you have the tools:

```bash
swift --version
```

It should say `Apple Swift version 6` or higher. If it prints "command not
found" or opens an install dialog, install them:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If it shows Swift 5.x, your tools are too old: update them in System
Settings › General › Software Update. If no Swift 6 update is offered, update
macOS first; the Swift 6 tools need a recent macOS 14 or newer.

The download is a few GB if you don't have the tools yet. The full Xcode app
(16 or newer) works too, but isn't needed.

### Build and install

Pick a folder for the source, for example `~/Developer`, and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michael-smao/git-cowork.git
```

```bash
cd git-cowork && make install
```

This builds the app and copies it to `/Applications/git-cowork.app`. Open it
from Launchpad or Spotlight. Keep the `git-cowork` folder: you'll use it to
update.

To install only for your user (no admin rights needed):

```bash
make install PREFIX=~/Applications
```

#### Stable release or latest main?

`git clone` gives you `main`, which has the newest changes. If you'd rather
stay on tested releases, switch to the newest release tag before installing:

```bash
git checkout $(git tag --list 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -1) && make install
```

`make update` remembers your choice: on `main` it pulls the latest
commits, on a release it moves to the next release.

### Update a source install

From the `git-cowork` folder:

```bash
make update
```

That fetches the new version, rebuilds and reinstalls. Quit and reopen the
app to use it. If you installed with `PREFIX=~/Applications`, pass the same
`PREFIX` again.

Check which version you have: **git-cowork › About git-cowork** shows e.g.
"Version 0.1.0 (1448777)", the release number and the commit it was built
from. In the terminal, `make version` prints the same for the source folder.
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed.

Install a specific version (or go back to an older one):

```bash
git fetch --tags && git checkout v0.1.0 && make install
```

Go back to following `main`:

```bash
git checkout main && make update
```

## Open repos from the terminal

```bash
open -a git-cowork .
```

Add a short alias to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
alias gk='open -a git-cowork'
```

Then `gk .` opens the current repo.

## Uninstall

Installed from source: `make uninstall` in the `git-cowork` folder.
Installed with the one-line script: move `git-cowork.app` to the Trash and
remove the `git cowork` link:

```bash
unlink ~/.local/bin/git-cowork
```

Settings (editor, terminal, recent repos) stay in
`~/Library/Preferences/ai.smao.git-cowork.plist`; to remove them too:

```bash
defaults delete ai.smao.git-cowork
```

Tasks and reviews live in your repositories (on `refs/cowork/main`), not in
the app, so uninstalling doesn't touch them.

## Troubleshooting

**`package '…' is using Swift tools version 6.0.0 but the installed version
is 5.x`** — your Command Line Tools are too old. See
[Requirements](#requirements) for how to update them.

**`make: command not found` or `xcrun: error: invalid active developer path`**
— the Command Line Tools are missing or were removed by a macOS update. Run
`xcode-select --install`.

**Build errors after a macOS or Xcode update** — clear the build cache and try
again: `make clean && make install`.

**"git-cowork can't be opened because Apple cannot check it"** or **"Apple
could not verify git-cowork"** — the app was downloaded in a browser or sent to
you, and macOS blocks those. Run the [one-line install](#quick-install) or use
[Homebrew](#homebrew); the one-line install replaces the blocked copy. Building
from source works too.

**`make update` says "You have local changes"** — you edited files in the
source folder. Keep them with `git stash`, or throw them away with
`git checkout .`, then run `make update` again.

**`make update` says "Not possible to fast-forward"** — your local `main` has
commits that aren't upstream. If you don't need them:
`git reset --hard origin/main && make install`.

Anything else: [open an issue](https://github.com/michael-smao/git-cowork/issues)
with the version from the About window.
