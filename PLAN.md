# git-cowork — plan

A small, fast Mac git client for teams that work on many branches and worktrees at once.
It wraps the `git` CLI, shows branches and history clearly, handles worktrees
well, and adds lightweight shared tasks and review requests that sync through
git itself. No AI features, no server. Accounts are optional: you can sign
in to GitHub or GitLab (section 10), and the app works the same without it.

Status: phase 1 (git client), phase 2 (cowork: tasks, board, reviews, comments, mentions, notifications, the `git cowork` tool) and phase 3 (public release, one-line install, in-app updates; latest release 0.2.0) are built — see README.md. Phase 4 (accounts) is partly built, see section 10. Open source under the MIT license.

## 1. Goals and non-goals

Goals
- Daily git: fetch, pull, push, merge, rebase, branch, stash, stage, commit.
- Clear commit graph and branch list.
- First-class worktrees (agents run in them).
- Works the same with GitHub, GitLab, Gitea and Forgejo.
- Small shared backlog, task tracking and "please review this branch".
- Fast: idle at 0% CPU, low memory, instant start.

Non-goals
- AI anything.
- Replacing Slack, or being a full Jira.
- Host features that need the API (PR lists, CI status) in v1. Planned, see section 10.
- Windows or Linux (macOS on Apple Silicon only).

## 2. Tech stack

**Swift + SwiftUI for the app shell, AppKit for the heavy views.**

| Option | App size | Memory (typical) | Idle CPU | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Swift / SwiftUI + AppKit** (chosen) | ~5–10 MB | ~40–90 MB | 0% | Native controls, no runtime, builds with Command Line Tools only (verified on this machine: Swift 6.1, macOS 15, arm64). |
| Tauri (Rust + system WebKit) | ~10 MB | ~120–250 MB | low | Web UI is easier to style, but a web view per window and a JS bridge. Cross-platform we don't need. |
| Zed's GPUI (Rust) | ~15 MB | low | 0% | Very fast, but the API is young and changes often. Risky for a small team. |
| Electron (what GitKraken uses) | 150+ MB | 300 MB+ | high | The thing we're leaving. |

The memory numbers are typical ranges, not measurements of this app. We'll
measure once there's a build (see the performance targets in section 6).

Why native:
- The "UI library" is AppKit/SwiftUI itself: buttons, sidebars, tables, menus,
  keyboard shortcuts, dark mode and accessibility come built in. It looks like
  a Mac app (Finder, Xcode), not a generic web dashboard.
- Big lists (commit graph, diffs) use `NSTableView` with Core Graphics drawing.
  That stays smooth with tens of thousands of rows, where SwiftUI lists slow down.
- No third-party dependencies to start with. If needed later: Apple's
  `swift-markdown` for rendering task text.

Git access: **always the `git` CLI**, not libgit2. That way the app picks up each
person's config, SSH keys and agent (1Password and similar), credential helpers,
hooks, signing and LFS. It's also exactly what you'd type in a terminal, so a
command log can show it.

Build: Swift Package Manager + a `make app` script that wraps the binary into
`git-cowork.app` and ad-hoc signs it. No Xcode project needed.

## 3. Features — phase 1: git client

Layout (one window per repo, like Fork / GitKraken tabs):

```
┌───────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐

│ command log: $ git fetch --all --prune   ✓ 0.8s                          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Repos**: open folder, recent list, clone.
- **Worktrees** (top of the sidebar): every worktree with branch, dirty count and
  ahead/behind. Click to switch the window to it. Add (new or existing branch),
  remove, prune, open in Finder / Terminal / editor. Good for watching what
  several agents are doing at once.
- **Graph**: all branches, lanes with stable colors, branch/tag badges on rows,
  "uncommitted changes" row on top, filter by message/author/sha, loads more
  on scroll.
- **Branches**: local (grouped by `feature/`, `claude/`, …), remotes, tags,
  stashes. Context menu: checkout, merge into current, rebase onto, push,
  rename, delete, create worktree, open PR/MR in browser.
- **Commits**: checkout, branch/tag here, cherry-pick, revert, reset
  (soft/mixed/hard, hard asks first), copy sha, open on host.
- **Working copy**: staged / unstaged / untracked, stage per file, discard
  (asks first), commit, amend.
- **Diff viewer**: unified, line numbers, handles big and binary files.
- **Merge/rebase in progress**: banner with Continue / Abort, list of
  conflicted files, open in editor, mark resolved.
- **Toolbar**: Fetch, Pull (default / ff-only / rebase), Push (sets upstream
  when there's none; force-with-lease asks first), Branch, Stash, Pop.
- **Command log**: every command the app runs that changes something, with
  output and timing. Errors show git's real message.
- **Hosts**: turns remote URLs into web links for GitHub, GitLab,
  Gitea/Forgejo (PR/MR page, commit, branch). Self-hosted names can be mapped
  in Settings (e.g. `git.company.com = gitlab`).
- **Live refresh**: watches the repo with FSEvents (no polling). Uses
  `--no-optional-locks` so the app's own `git status` doesn't trigger
  refreshes.

## 4. Features — phase 2: cowork (tasks, backlog, reviews)

### Where the shared data lives: inside the repo's git, on a hidden ref

Tasks are stored as small text files in git, under a ref the app manages,
`refs/cowork/main`. It's pushed and fetched like any branch, so it works on
GitHub, GitLab, Gitea and Forgejo without tokens, accounts or a server.

- Not a normal branch: it doesn't show up in branch lists, PR pickers or
  agents' `git branch` output.
- Written with git plumbing (`hash-object`, `mktree`, `commit-tree`,
  `update-ref`) into a temporary index. **It never touches anyone's working
  tree.**
- Plain text: Markdown with a small header. People can read it with
  `git show refs/cowork/main:tasks/CW-12.md`. Agents use the `git cowork`
  command-line tool (built; `Sources/GitCoworkCLI`, on top of
  `Sources/CoworkKit`, which the app shares).
- Prior art: `git-bug` stores issues in git refs the same way.

Downside: tasks aren't visible in the host's web UI, since custom refs aren't
shown there. If you'd rather browse them on the web, the alternative is an
orphan branch named `cowork`, which is visible on the web but shows up in
branch lists.

```
refs/cowork/main
├── team.md                         # optional: names, handles, emails
├── tasks/
│   ├── CW-a3f9.md                  # one file per task
│   └── CW-a3f9/
│       └── comments/
│           └── <stamp>-<rnd>.md    # one file per comment
└── reviews/
    ├── R-7k2p.md                   # one per review request
    └── R-7k2p/comments/<stamp>-<rnd>.md
```

Task file:

```markdown
---
id: CW-a3f9
title: Cache user sessions
status: doing          # backlog | todo | doing | review | done
assignee: anna@example.com
labels: [backend]
branch: feat/session-cache
created: 2026-11-06T20:40:00Z
updated: 2026-11-06T21:02:00Z
---
Sessions hit the DB on every request. Cache them for 5 minutes.
```

Sync without conflicts:
- One file per task and per comment, and IDs are random short hashes, not
  counters. Two people editing different things never touch the same file.
- If two people edit the same task while offline, the newer `updated:` wins
  for each field. Comments are only ever added, so they never conflict.
- The app fetches just this ref (one tiny request) every minute while it's in
  front and every 3 minutes behind, when it comes to the front, and right
  after every normal fetch. Sync uses the remote in `git config cowork.remote`
  (shared with `git cowork`).

### What you get

- **Backlog and board**: columns Backlog / Todo / Doing / Review / Done, drag
  to move. Filter by assignee and label. Keyboard-first: `N` for a new task,
  arrow keys to move.
- **Task ↔ branch link**: "Start task" creates the branch (and optionally a
  worktree) named `CW-a3f9-cache-sessions`. The graph shows the task id on
  that branch.
- **Review requests**: right-click a branch → "Request review" → pick
  teammates. They see it in a **Reviews** inbox with the branch diff against
  its base, can comment, and mark it *Approved* or *Changes requested*.
  Optional button: open a PR/MR on the host with the same title.
- **Mentions and notifications**: `@anna` in a task or comment sends Anna a
  macOS notification when her app next syncs. Identity is your
  `git config user.email`. Nothing to sign up for.
- **Chat**: deliberately **not** a live chat room. Comment threads on tasks
  and reviews arrive within about a minute (3 when the app is behind). Real-time chat needs a server,
  so for that you keep using Slack (or whatever you use).

## 5. Phase 3: open source release

Status: public on GitHub; license, README, screenshots and CI are done.
Every release tag builds the app, attaches it as a zip with its SHA-256, and
`install.sh` installs or updates it with one line (no Xcode). The app checks
GitHub once a day and installs updates on request (`App/Updater.swift`, which
runs the install.sh bundled in the app). Not done: Developer ID signing and
notarization (needs the paid Apple account; downloading with curl avoids the
Gatekeeper prompt meanwhile), a Homebrew cask, Sparkle.

- License (MIT or Apache-2.0), README, screenshots. Done.
- Developer ID signing and notarization (Apple Developer account, $99/yr) so
  browser downloads open without Gatekeeper warnings. Not done.
- GitHub Actions on macOS runners: build and test on every PR, release a zip
  on tags (done). DMG and Homebrew cask: not done.
- Updates: in-app check plus install.sh (done). Sparkle: not needed for now.

## 6. Performance targets

Targets for an M1/M2 MacBook with a repo of ~50k commits. Not measured yet:
- Cold start to usable window: < 300 ms.
- Idle CPU: ~0% (FSEvents; the only timers are the cowork sync, the 5-minute
  background fetch, which only runs while the app is in front, and the daily
  update check).
- Memory: < 100 MB with 10k commits loaded.
- Graph scroll: no dropped frames at 120 Hz.
- First 2,000 commits on screen: < 150 ms; more load on scroll.

## 7. Code layout

```
Package.swift
Sources/
  GitCoworkCore/    pure logic, no UI, unit-tested: parsers, graph layout,
                    diff model, names, remote links, cowork models/codec/merge
                    rules, task start, accounts parsing, release check
  CoworkKit/        reads, writes and syncs refs/cowork/main (shared by app
                    and CLI); process runner, git environment, sync remote
  GitCoworkCLIKit/  argument parsing and people lookup for the CLI
  GitCoworkCLI/     the `git-cowork` executable
  GitCowork/        the app
    App/            entry, windows, menus, settings, updater, Debug/ self-tests
    Accounts/       sign-in, Keychain, SSH keys, repo lists
    Git/            GitRunner, RepoModel and its actions, cowork store/sync
    Views/          Theme, shared components, Chrome/, Sidebar/, History/,
                    Diff/, Inspector/, Cowork/
Resources/          icon, en/de translations
Tests/              GitCoworkCoreTests, CoworkKitTests, GitCoworkCLITests
Scripts/            build-app.sh, release.sh, update.sh, version.sh,
                    check-translations.py, make-icon.swift
install.sh          one-line install and update
```

Code style: small files, plain names, no premature abstraction, comments only
where something isn't obvious.

## 8. Decisions taken

1. **Cowork storage**: hidden ref `refs/cowork/main` (not shown in branch lists or web UIs).
2. **Minimum macOS**: 14 Sonoma.
3. **Chat**: no live chat; comment threads on tasks and reviews, synced every minute and on Fetch.
4. **Review requests**: kept in the app; the Request Review sheet can also open the host's PR/MR page.

How sync works: writes go through a temporary index and git plumbing, never the
working tree or HEAD. Sync fetches the ref (without touching FETCH_HEAD), merges
file by file with a field-level three-way merge, and pushes with `--no-verify`.
Proven by the built-in self-test (`GITCOWORK_SELFTEST=<dir>`): two clones,
concurrent edits, comments and approvals.

## 9. Build order

1. Skeleton app, GitRunner, command log, open repo.
2. Graph layout + history view (the hard part; unit-tested first).
3. Branch sidebar + actions; toolbar fetch/pull/push.
4. Working copy, diff, commit.
5. Worktrees panel.
6. Merge/rebase states, conflict handling.
7. Packaging (`make app`) and daily use on our own repos.
8. Cowork: store + sync, then board, then reviews, then notifications. (done)
9. Phase 3: open source release, 0.1.0 (see section 5).
10. Phase 4 — host sign-in (built), then SSH key and host features (section 10).

## 10. Phase 4: signing in to GitHub and GitLab

Status: sign-in and "making git use the token" are built (Settings >
Accounts; code in `Sources/GitCowork/Accounts` and
`Sources/GitCoworkCore/Accounts`). Browser sign-in on github.com and
gitlab.com needs our OAuth apps registered and their client IDs filled into
`OAuthApps.swift`; until then it asks for a client ID, and tokens work.
"Clone from your repos" (item 1 below) is built: the Clone sheet lists the
signed-in accounts' repos (`HostAPI` repo listing in core,
`Accounts/RepoList.swift` and `Views/CloneRepoList.swift` in the app). The
optional SSH key is built too (Settings > Accounts > Create SSH Key; tested
against a local sshd, not yet against a real GitHub/GitLab account). Not
built yet: items 2 and 3 below, the `Hosts/` protocol, the message for
GitHub orgs that block OAuth apps, and a "Sign in" button on auth errors
(a failed push or fetch only says to sign in under Settings > Accounts).

How git gets the token: `git credential-cache` on a private socket, plus
`-c credential.https://<host>.helper=` (clears the person's helpers for that
host, so osxkeychain never stores a copy) and
`-c credential.https://<host>.helper=cache --socket …`. The cache is filled
before each fetch/pull/push/clone and stopped when the app quits.

Goal: as easy as GitKraken. Click "Sign in with GitHub" (or GitLab), approve
in the browser, and push and pull work, even on a Mac where git was never set
up. Optional: anyone whose SSH keys or credential helpers already work keeps
using them, and the app works without an account.

Today the app runs with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, so an HTTPS push with no
credential helper just fails. That's the gap this fills first.

### Sign-in

- **GitHub**: OAuth device flow. The app shows a short code, you approve it on
  github.com. No client secret ships in the app and no redirect URL is needed.
- **GitLab** (gitlab.com and self-hosted, 17.3 or later): the same device
  flow. (The plan was OAuth with PKCE; the device flow needs no redirect.)
- **Gitea and Forgejo**: personal access token.
- Self-hosted servers need their own OAuth app registered on that server. If
  that's not possible, paste a personal access token instead.
- Tokens go in the macOS Keychain, one per host and account. Sign out in
  Settings removes them.

### Making git use the token

- The app passes a credential helper (git's own `credential-cache`, see
  Status above) only on the git commands it runs itself, per host, with `-c`
  options like the ones in `GitDefaults`. It never writes to the person's
  global git config, so the terminal is unchanged.
- If a credential helper or SSH key already works for a remote, the app leaves
  it alone. Sign-in is in Settings; a push or fetch that fails with an auth
  error points there.

### Optional SSH key

- "Create SSH key" generates an ed25519 key, uploads it through the host's API
  (GitHub `POST /user/keys`, GitLab `POST /user/keys`), and saves it under
  `~/.ssh/` with its passphrase in the Keychain.
- The app uses it for its own commands via `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` with
  `IdentitiesOnly=yes`. It doesn't edit `~/.ssh/config`. A button can add the
  `Host` entry for people who want the terminal to use the key too.
- HTTPS plus a token is the default. The SSH key is an extra.
- As built: the key goes to `~/.ssh/git-cowork_<host>` (`_2`, `_3` if taken)
  with a random passphrase that `ssh-add --apple-use-keychain` keeps; the key
  is then removed from ssh-agent so the terminal doesn't offer it everywhere.
  `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` is `/usr/bin/ssh -F <app config>`, where the app config
  has a `Host <host>` block (`IdentityFile`, `IdentitiesOnly yes`,
  `UseKeychain yes`) and then includes `~/.ssh/config` and
  `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, so only that host's remotes change, and remotes
  using an alias from the person's config are untouched. Skipped when the
  person sets `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, `GIT_SSH` or `core.sshCommand`. "SSH Host
  Entry…" shows the block to copy instead of writing `~/.ssh/config`.
- Scopes: GitHub `write:public_key` (added to sign-in); GitLab has nothing
  narrower than `api`, which sign-in now asks for (MRs need it too). Older
  tokens get "sign in again". Code: `SSHKey` and `HostAPI.addSSHKeyRequest`
  in core, `SSHKeys` (keygen, upload) and `Credentials.sshCommand` in the app.
- Not handled: SSH hosts with a different name than the web host (some
  self-hosted GitLab setups), and Gitea/Forgejo keys.

### What signing in unlocks

In this order:
1. Clone from a list of your repos (and your orgs' repos). Built.
2. PRs/MRs: list open ones, show them on branches in the graph, create one
   from the app instead of only opening the web page.
3. CI status on branches and commits.

### Things to know

- We register one OAuth app on github.com and one on gitlab.com. The client
  IDs are public and can ship in the app.
- GitHub's classic `repo` scope covers all your private repos. A GitHub App
  gives finer control but needs installing per org. Start with an OAuth app,
  revisit later.
- Some GitHub orgs block OAuth apps until an admin approves them. GitKraken
  has the same limit. Show a clear message with a link to the approval page.
- Code: a `Hosts/` provider per host (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea/Forgejo) behind one
  small protocol, building on `HostKind` and `RemoteLinks` in GitCoworkCore.
  Token storage and the helper live in the app target, and request/response
  parsing goes in core with tests.
