# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! Bug reports, ideas and pull requests are welcome.

## Getting started

Requirements: Apple Silicon Mac, macOS 14+, Xcode Command Line Tools with Swift 6.

```bash
make run        # debug build, run from the terminal
make test       # unit tests
make app        # build dist/git-cowork.app
```

No Xcode project and no third-party dependencies.

## Guidelines

- **Keep it light.** The app should stay near 0% CPU when nothing changes.
  It watches files instead of polling them. The only timers are the task sync
  (every minute in front, every 3 minutes behind), the background fetch
  (every 5 minutes, only in front) and the daily update check; don't add
  more without a good reason.
- **Plain git.** Every action runs the `git` CLI through `GitRunner`, so it
  shows up in the command log and respects the user's config. No libgit2.
- **Logic goes in `GitCoworkCore`** (pure Swift, no UI) and gets a test.
  UI goes in `GitCowork`.
- **Design tokens.** Spacing, colors and fonts come from `Theme`; shared
  pieces (badges, rows, headers, sheets) live in `Components`. Heavy lists
  use AppKit and draw directly.
- Keep pull requests focused, and add a screenshot for UI changes.

## Releasing (maintainers)

The version lives in `Resources/Info.plist`. To cut a release:

1. Make sure `CHANGELOG.md` has entries under `## [Unreleased]`.
2. Run `make release VERSION=x.y.z` on a clean `main`. It runs the tests,
   sets the version, dates the changelog section, commits and creates the
   tag `vx.y.z`.
3. Push: `git push origin main vx.y.z`. The Release workflow builds and
   tests, then publishes a GitHub release with the changelog notes and
   attaches `git-cowork-x.y.z-macos-arm64.zip` plus its `.sha256`. The
   one-line install and the in-app updater download that zip, so check that
   both files are on the release.

Bump PATCH for fixes, MINOR for new features, MAJOR for breaking changes
(for example to the cowork file format on `refs/cowork/main`).

## Translations

UI text is written in English in the code; translations live in
`Resources/<lang>.lproj/Localizable.strings`, keyed by the English text.
SwiftUI literals (`Text("Commit")`) are looked up automatically. Text that
travels as a `String` goes through `Text(ui:)` or `L("…")`, and text with
values uses `String(localized: "Delete \(name)?")` (key `Delete %@?`).
Write whole sentences, not fragments glued together, so they translate.

```bash
make check-translations   # lists text without a German translation
```

To add a language, copy `de.lproj`, translate the values, and add the code
to `CFBundleLocalizations` in `Resources/Info.plist`.

## Debug aids

These exist in debug builds only (`swift build`, `make run`); release builds
from `make app` / `make install` don't contain them.

Render the window to a PNG without screen-recording permission:

```bash
GITCOWORK_SNAPSHOT=/tmp/shot.png GITCOWORK_SNAPSHOT_QUIT=1 .build/debug/GitCowork /path/to/repo
```

- `GITCOWORK_SNAPSHOT_DELAY=<seconds>`
- `GITCOWORK_DEBUG_SELECT=commit:<n> | diff | commitdiff:<n>`
- `GITCOWORK_DEBUG_MODE=board | reviews` (add `:<n>` to select the nth task or review)
- `GITCOWORK_DEBUG_APPEARANCE=light | dark`
- `GITCOWORK_DEBUG_UPDATE=check | install` with `GIT_COWORK_API_BASE=…` and
  `GIT_COWORK_DOWNLOAD_BASE=…` (the same variables install.sh reads): runs the
  updater against a test release server and quits, with exit code 1 if it
  didn't work (run it from inside an app bundle). Release builds ignore both
  variables and pass install.sh only what it needs.
- `GITCOWORK_DEBUG_LOG=1` (open the command log, e.g. to see the background fetch)

End-to-end cowork sync test against a local bare remote with two clones:

```bash
GITCOWORK_SELFTEST=/tmp/empty-dir .build/debug/GitCowork
```

The folder must be empty or one a previous self-test created; anything else
is refused, never deleted. Add `GITCOWORK_SELFTEST_SEED=1` for extra demo tasks.

You can pass several folders to `.build/debug/GitCowork a b c` to get one
tab each.
